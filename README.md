# ArticleCatalog
## Overview
ArticleCatalog is an API designed to manage stores, products and stores' inventories. Developed using ASP.NETCore and Entity Framework. Layered architecture pattern is used, separation of concerns is provided which leads to maintainability, and scalability.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several layers:

1. API Layer: Contains the controllers and is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. Validation happens on this level. ViewModels -- are the models here.
2. Business Logic Layer (BLL): Contains the services responsible for the business logic. DTOs -- are the models here.
3. Data Access Layer (DAL): Contains the repositories responsible for data access. Entities -- are the models here. They Contain the data models representing the database entities.

## Key Patterns
1. Repository Pattern: Abstracts the data layer, providing a clear separation between data access and business logic.
2. Dependency Injection: Ensures loose coupling and enhances testability. Provided by Microsoft.
3. Data Mapper is used for the database, provided by Microsoft with Entity Framework.
4. Anemic domain model is used to manage business logic. DTOs represent the real-life structure and services provide the functionality.
5. Async/Await: Utilized throughout to ensure non-blocking operations.


## Usage
Prerequisites
.NET SDK installed
PostgreSQL database (if using the database repository)

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ArticleCatalog.git
cd ArticleCatalog
```

```sh
dotnet restore
```
Configure the Database and File Paths: Update appsettings.json with your PostgreSQL connection string and file paths:
```json
{
    "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Host=my_host;Database=my_database;Username=my_user;Password=my_password"
    },
    "RepositoryType": "File",
    "StoreFilePath": "./files/store.csv",
    "ProductFilePath": "./files/product.csv",
    "InventoryFilePath": "./files/inventory.csv"
}
```

Run Migrations (if using the database):
```sh
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```
